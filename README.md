##CMJ Problem 1230
A Heronian triangle is a triangle with positive integer side lengths and positive integer area. Denoting the side lengths of a Heronian triangle by a, b, and c, the triangle is called primitive if gcd(a, b, c) = 1. We shall say that a primitive Heronian triangle has an equivalent rectangle if there exists a rectangle with integer length and width that shares the same perimeter and area as the triangle. Show that infinitely many primitive Heronian triangles have equivalent rectangles.

##Abstract
This paper explores how results from computational resources used to generate example cases of primitive Heronian triangles with equivalent rectangles can be used to examine relationships between the side lengths of these triangles. From these relationships, equations are derived for the side lengths of these triangles to prove that there are infinitely many of these special triangles.
